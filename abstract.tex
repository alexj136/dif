\begin{abstract}
    \noindent DOT (Dependent Object Types) is an object calculus with
    path-dependent types and abstract type members, developed to serve as a
    theoretical foundation for the Scala programming language. As yet, DOT does
    not model all of Scala's features, but a small subset. We present the
    calculus DIF (DOT with Implicit Functions), which extends the set of
    features modelled by DOT to include implicit functions, a feature of Scala
    to aid modularity of programs. We show type safety of DIF, and demonstrate
    that the generic programming focused use cases for implicit functions in
    Scala are also expressible in DIF.
