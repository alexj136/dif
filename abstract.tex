    \noindent DOT (Dependent Object Types) is an object calculus with
    path-dependent types and abstract type members, developed to serve as a
    theoretical foundation for the Scala programming language. As yet, DOT
    does not model all of Scala's features, but a small subset. We present
    the calculus DIF (DOT with Implicit Functions), which extends the set of
    features modelled by DOT to include implicit functions, a feature of
    Scala to aid modularity of programs. We show type safety of DIF, lending
    a higher degree of confidence to the correctness of implicit functions
    in Scala. We demonstrate that typical use cases for implicit functions
    in Scala are typably expressible in DIF.
