\section{Conclusion}

The key aim of DOT is to provide a theoretical foundation for Scala. We extend
the existing foundation to include implicits, a feature widely used in Scala
programming.

Scala's lack of type classes mean that implicits must be leveraged to achieve
such behaviour. We have demonstrated the robustness of this approach with a
typable example in a type-sound calculus.
